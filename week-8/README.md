## Helper Scripts for Week 8
Hi everyone, 
This is a directory of helper scripts for **Week 8**. 
### Features
- **Load All Airports**: 
  This functionality allows you to load all airport data, including the new ones that may be missing from your databases. 
Note: The script has worked for me, but I cannot guarantee it will work for everyone else—**use at your own risk**. 
### How to Use
1. Create a virtual environment (**venv**) and install the required dependencies.
2. Create a .env file with your Redshift login credentials (you can copy-paste them exactly as provided by the coaches). 
3. Run the script.
### Additional Notes
- **Internet Connection Required**: The script needs an active internet connection to function. 
- **Run Time**: The process will likely take around **1 minute**, but this may vary depending on: 
  - The number of open connections to our database cluster. 
  - Your local connection speed.
